# Stochastic-Tube-MPC-Driver-Assistant

This repository contains the Matlab Script developed by me in order to replicate the paper *Stochastic predictive control for semi-autonomous vehicles with an uncertain driver model* [(Link)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6728575). This code is part of an initial study about Stochastic Model Predictive Control that I posted in my ResearchGate [(Link)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343385611_Estudo_Dirigido_-_Estudo_de_Controladores_Preditivos_Estocasticos).  

Feel free to ask me any doubts, I will be happy to discuss about this topic.
